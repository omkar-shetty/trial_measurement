# Trial Measurements

An exploration of different trial measurement techniques. The laundry list of techniques covered (as well as to be covered) include :  
* Comparing a ratio based method vs Difference in Differences: [Notebook](https://github.com/omkar-shetty/trial_measurement/blob/master/notebooks/compare_measurement_methods.md)
* Bayesian Implementation of Difference-in-differences: [Notebook](https://github.com/omkar-shetty/trial_measurement/blob/master/notebooks/bayesian_did.md)
* Measuring Trials with a binary outcome: [Notebook](https://github.com/omkar-shetty/trial_measurement/blob/master/notebooks/binary_trial_design_upd.md)

To Be Added :  

* Bayesian implementation of DiD
* a conjugate prior based version of Bayes rule
